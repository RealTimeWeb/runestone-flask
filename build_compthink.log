C:\Users\acbart\projects\runestone\books\compthink\_sources\Modelling\NetLogo.rst:4: WARNING: undecodable source characters, replacing with "?": 'NetLogo is an application using simulation to explore phenomenon in a wide variety of subjects.  The figure below shows the initial display that is presented when NetLogo is run. As we explore NetLogo further we will learn more about some of the NetLogo interface. First, note the >>>\x93<<<File\x94 menu in the upper left corner. We will see next how to find pre-developed NetLogo simulation models under the File menu. Also, note the large black area. This is the main simulation display. When a simulation model is run the visualization of the model will be shown in this display area. '

This window is shown in the following figure. As you can see there are sample models in art, biology, mathematics, social science, and other fields. In all there are over 100 sample models. The models library also contains a collection of Curricular Models, models that have been developed for use in specific courses. The community of NetLogo users has also developed other models that they have made available. You can see these models by clicking on the \x93Go to User Community Models web page\x94 button at the bottom of the Models Library page. This will send your browser to a web page that describes each model and has a link for downloading the model. '
