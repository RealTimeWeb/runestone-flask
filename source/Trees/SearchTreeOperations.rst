Before we look at the implementation, letâ€™s review the interface
provided by the map ADT. You will notice that this interface is very
similar to the Python dictionary.

-  ``Map()`` Create a new, empty map.

-  ``put(key,val)`` Add a new key-value pair to the map. If the key is
   already in the map then replace the old value with the new value.

-  ``get(key)`` Given a key, return the value stored in the map or
   ``None`` otherwise.

-  ``del`` Delete the key-value pair from the map using a statement of
   the form ``del map[key]``.

-  ``len()`` Return the number of key-value pairs stored in the map.

-  ``in`` Return ``True`` for a statement of the form ``key in map``, if
   the given key is in the map.
