Algorithms
----------

.. mchoicemf:: question1_1
   :answer_a: Python
   :answer_b: Java
   :answer_c: C
   :answer_d: ML
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, Python is a great language to learn, whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer.
   :feedback_b: Java is a good object oriented language but it has some details that make it hard for the beginner.
   :feedback_c: C is an imperative programming language that has been around for a long time, but it is not the one that we use.
   :feedback_d: No, ML is a functional programming language.  You can use Python to write functional programs as well.

Creativity
----------

Of course, data is beautiful.

Looking at visualizations of data can activate the same neural circuitry as traditional works of art. [Citation]
