Welcome to Computational Thinking. Please pay attention to the following problems.

This is a new test. I hope this works so I can put this down and focus on grading.

   :submission: cohort
   :answer_a: Python
   :answer_b: Java
   :answer_c: C
   :answer_d: ML
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, Python is a great language to learn, whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer.
   :feedback_b: Java is a good object oriented language but it has some details that make it hard for the beginner.
   :feedback_c: C is an imperative programming language that has been around for a long time, but it is not the one that we use.
   :feedback_d: No, ML is a functional programming language.  You can use Python to write functional programs as well.

   What programming language does this site help you to learn?


Of course, data is beautiful.

Looking at visualizations of data can activate the same neural circuitry as traditional works of art. [Citation]

This is a test. The test has been continued.
