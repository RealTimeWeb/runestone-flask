Objectives
----------

-  To understand the abstract data types stack, queue, deque, and list.

-  To be able to implement the ADTs stack, queue, and deque using Python
   lists.

-  To understand the performance of the implementations of basic linear
   data structures.

-  To understand prefix, infix, and postfix expression formats.

-  To use stacks to evaluate postfix expressions.

-  To use stacks to convert expressions from infix to postfix.

-  To use queues for basic timing simulations.

-  To be able to recognize problem properties where stacks, queues, and
   deques are appropriate data structures.

-  To be able to implement the abstract data type list as a linked list
   using the node and reference pattern.

-  To be able to compare the performance of our linked list
   implementation with Pythonâ€™s list implementation.
