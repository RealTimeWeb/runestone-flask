The Graph Abstract Data Type
----------------------------

The graph abstract data type (ADT) is defined as follows:

-  ``Graph()`` creates a new, empty graph.

-  ``addVertex(vert)`` adds an instance of ``Vertex`` to the graph.

-  ``addEdge(fromVert, toVert)`` Adds a new, directed edge to the graph
   that connects two vertices.

-  ``addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight)`` Adds a new, weighted, directed
   edge to the graph that connects two vertices.

-  ``getVertex(vertKey)`` finds the vertex in the graph named
   ``vertKey``.

-  ``getVertices()`` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.

-  ``in`` returns ``True`` for a statement of the form
   ``vertex in graph``, if the given vertex is in the graph, ``False``
   otherwise.

Beginning with the formal definition for a graph there are several ways
we can implement the graph ADT in Python. We will see that there are
trade-offs in using different representations to implement the ADT
described above. There are two well-known implementations of a graph,
the **adjacency matrix** and the **adjacency list**. We will explain
both of these options, and then implement one as a Python class.
