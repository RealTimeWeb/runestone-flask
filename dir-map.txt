cache/
    Temporary files generated during the server's run
common/
    When we need to include files on the client-side, they typically come from here. It has Javascript, CSS, Images, and the magic for the directives. So if it's not book specific client-side stuff, it's put in here.
compthink/
    Our textbook
    
    _sources/
        The main RST files
        
    conf.py
        Important configuration settings.
        
controllers/
    This is the main "Controllers" folder; basically, the main logic for the website.
    
    admin.py
        This holds the commands that an Instructor sees when they manage their course.
        
    ajax.py
        These are the endpoints from the ajax requests that pages/directives make.
    
    appadmin.py
        Runestone level commands for manipulating the database and such
    
    default.py
        Seems to be logic for manipulating and rendering user information
        
    designer.py
        Handles logic for the creation, deletion, and building of courses
    
    everyday.py
    feed.py
        These two handle logic for printing out some kind of feed. They probably won't show up in our book, although we may hijack the newsfeed.
            
cron/
    Mostly unused folder, I assume if we want to add any cron commands, this is the canonical place to do so.
    
databases/
    All the tables generated are stored here using some kind of .table format. The "storage.sqlite" is the sqlite database, and the "sql.log" is next to it.
    
devcourse/
    Just a development course I'm guessing.

doctrees/
    These are apparently generated files, something that sphinx or web2py uses internally.
    
errors/
    HTML Error files generated by web2py that include a lot of helpful debugging data.

ext_test/
    A simple course for testing extensions
    
Java4Python/
    The textbook for Java4Python
    
languages/
    Translation files for the books
    
models/
    The source code for generating the database
    
    0.py
        The settings for the site
    1.py
        The private settings for this site, not committed to the database
    db.py
        Most of the main tables (e.g., "courses", "auth_users")
    db_ebook.py
        The ebook related tables, e.g., tracking user state within a book.
    menu.py
    modulesmodels.py
        These apparently are somehow concatenated with other files, because they definitely can't run on their own.
    
modules/
    <username>/<module_name>/
        This is the code for the directives on the backend, usually to generate their client side code.
        There is already good documentation for how to add new modules, fortunately.
        
newproject_copy_me/
    This is the template project that can be copied and edited to create your own book.
